## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=18.0.0 recommended based on dependencies)
- pnpm

### Installation Steps

1.  Clone the project:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd asetools
    ```

2.  Install dependencies (using pnpm is recommended based on the `pnpm` section in `package.json`):
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    # Or if pnpm is not installed globally:
    # npx pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Development Mode**: To start the application in development mode with hot reloading:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

4.  **Preview Production Build**: To build the application and run a preview:
    ```bash
    pnpm start
    ```

5.  **Build for Production**: To create distributable packages for your platform:
    ```bash
    # For Windows:
    pnpm build:win

    # For macOS:
    pnpm build:mac

    # For Linux:
    pnpm build:linux

    # For a platform-specific unpacked directory (for testing):
    pnpm build:unpack
    ```

## Project Structure & Scripts

- **`main`**: Points to the compiled Electron main process entry point (`./out/main/index.js`).
- **`scripts`**:
  - `dev`: Starts the application in development mode using `electron-vite dev`.
  - `start`: Builds and previews the production build using `electron-vite preview`.
  - `build`: Runs type checks and then builds the application using `electron-vite build`.
  - `build:win/mac/linux/unpack`: Scripts to build distributable packages for specific platforms using `electron-builder`.
  - `typecheck`: Runs TypeScript type checks for both main and renderer processes.
  - `lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
  - `format`: Formats the codebase using Prettier.
  - `postinstall`: Runs `electron-builder install-app-deps` after dependencies are installed.

## Main Components

### Header Component

Top navigation bar component, including:

- **Logo Area**: Displays ASETools brand identity
- **Main Menu**: Quick access to 7 core function modules
- **Search Function**: Global search box
- **User Menu**: User-related operations (settings, notifications, messages, logout)

## Design Philosophy

ASETools adopts a simple and intuitive interface design, using a combination of icons and text to allow users to quickly understand and use various functions.
